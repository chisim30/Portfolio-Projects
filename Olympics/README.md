### Introduction
The goal of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on Historical Data of the Olympic Games, and see how much women's participation has improved over the years and also find out sports and countries driving women's participation in the games.

### Data Cleaning
There are 2 separate data sets used for this project, the first contains athlete data from the 1800 to 2016 Olympic games, while the second data set contains data from the 2020 Tokyo games. I had to take a few steps to prepare the data set for analysis.
1. Create matching columns for both dataframes.
2. Format data types of columns in each dataframe.
3. Joining both tables together to form a single dataframe.
4. Filter important data specific for analysis.

### Data Analysis
In this stage of the project I did data aggregation and grouping to find trends in womens participation in the games over the years and compared the results with that of the men. One more thing I did was to check what sports saw the highest number of female participants. Then finally I checked to see what countries had the most female participants in the games. 

### Conclusion
The Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games was the first ever gender-balanced Olympic Games, Athletics, Swimming, and Gymnastics are the major sports driving more participation from women at the Games. Countries like the United States of America, Great Britain, France, Netherlands, Japan, China, Italy and Germany are the leading countries when it comes to women's participation in the Games.
