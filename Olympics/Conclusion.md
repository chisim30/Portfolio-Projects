The Olympic Games being one of the biggest and most participated events in the world for athletes, 
started out not allowing women to watch the games not to even talk of participating in them. 
So with the help of data I have taken from Kaggle, I have been able to run a descriptive analysis on women's participation at the Olympic Games over the years, 
I have cleaned data, analyzed data, and used that data to create charts which has led me to believe that the Olympic Games is becoming or if not already is a Gender-Balanced Event.
