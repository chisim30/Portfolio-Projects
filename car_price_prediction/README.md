### Introduction
A new vehicle production company are about to launch their new line of cars and would like to know how the price tag to attach to each of their car brands, and I have been asked to make a model used to predict the price of each car. This is my first data science project, I obtained this data from the IBM Data Science course hosted on Coursera, I hope to get constructive criticism and also upvotes.

### Conclusion
All predictor variables had a Pearsons coefficient greater than 0.5 and p-values of less than 0.05 which make them useful in our model development. We achieved an r2 and variance of 0.91 and 0.93 respectively, which are both desired values. We performed cros validation on our training data set to obtain a value of 0.0448 making our model more likely to predict actual observations. We also performed Ridge Regression on our model to reduce the effects of multicollinearity on our model.
