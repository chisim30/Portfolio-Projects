### Scenario
Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.

Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

### Conclusion
Using Decision trees I have been able to create  model that can predict the specific drug to give to a patient in a similar condition based on their Age, Blood pressure levels, sodium-potassium pump, and cholesterol levels
