### Introduction
BikeShare Cyclist a bike transportation company based in Chicago, Illinois is faced with the issue of converting customer (casual) bike riders into members. I received a data set which includes subscriber and customer (casual) riders transport details for four quarters in the year 2019, the stakeholders at Cyclist Bikeshare have asked me to use data to inform decisions on turning customer riders into subscribers. For this project I will be using the six phases of data analysis according to Google, which are;
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act
### Ask
There are 3 main questions which my immediate stakeholder wants me to answer using this data
1. How do customer and subscriber riders differ in bike usage? 
2. Why would customer riders buy
a subscription? 
3. How can the company use digital media to influence customer riders to become
subscribers?
To find answers to the questions, I would first have to come up with a statement of the business
task.

#### Business Task
The main objective of this project is to examine behaviors of customer riders and provide data
informed suggestions that can turn them into subscriber riders.

### Prepare
For the prepare phase, a data set has been provided by the company’s data team, this clears up
the question of the data sets integrity. I can examine the data and perform cleaning before I start
my analysis.

### Process
The Process phase deals with data cleaning, which is basically making the data more useful for
analyses.

### Analyze
For this phase of the project, I tried to find relationships by aggregating and grouping columns in the data set,
which I will visualize in the Share phase of this project.

### Share
The Share phase of this project includes making visuals from my analysis that help stakeholders
understand my findings.

As expected the number of subscriber riders exceed that of the casual riders, I did some aggregation
to discover behaviors between the two categories.

Suprising to see that customer(casual) riders spend more time on average riding bikes than subscriber
riders

<img src="https://github.com/chisim30/PortfolioProject/blob/main/bikeshare_analysis/Images/month1.png" width="400" height="200">

In the months of June, July, August and September Casual riders were more than Subscribers,
but from October to December the Subsctibers were almost double the amount of Casual in every
month.

On the week days Subscriber riders spend more time on bikes than Casual riders, while in the
weekend Casual riders double Subscribers numbers.

Casual riders spend more time on bikes every day of the week than Subscribers, even though there
are more Subscriber riders in the week day than Casual riders.

<img src="https://github.com/chisim30/PortfolioProject/blob/main/bikeshare_analysis/Images/month2.png" width="400" height="200">

On average Casual riders spend more time on bikes than Subscriber riders in every month, in many
instances they even spend double the times of Subscribers.

<img src="https://github.com/chisim30/PortfolioProject/blob/main/bikeshare_analysis/Images/hour1.png" width="400" height="200">

From the hours between 08:00 - 20:00 there’s a rise in the number of Casual riders, while for the
Subscribers most use comes between 06:00 - 09:00, 11:00 - 14:00 and then again between 16:00 -
19:00.

<img src="https://github.com/chisim30/PortfolioProject/blob/main/bikeshare_analysis/Images/hour2.png" width="400" height="200">

There is a clear difference between the ride duration of Casual and Subscriber riders, Subscriber
riders spend around 700 seconds on average during trips, while Casual riders spend 2,000 seconds
on average during trips.

### Act
The objective of this portion of the project is to make decisions based on the findings from our
analysis. My stakeholder has asked for 3 data driven suggestions that can see Customer riders
become subscribers.
1. The marketing team can aid in developing advertisements meant to captivate Casual riders
to obtain subscriptions. From the data I would think a summer and weekend themed advert
would be the best angle to explore.
13
2. Discounts and Free trials should be explored as an option to reduce the number of Casual
riders.
3. Create exciting competitions on social media as a means to create awareness to potential
subscribers.
