### Introduction
BikeShare Cyclist a bike transportation company based in Chicago, Illinois is faced with the issue of converting customer (casual) bike riders into members. I received a data set which includes subscriber and customer (casual) riders transport details for four quarters in the year 2019, the stakeholders at Cyclist Bikeshare have asked me to use data to inform decisions on turning customer riders into subscribers. For this project I will be using the six phases of data analysis according to Google, which are;

Ask
Prepare
Process
Analyze
Share
Act

### Conclusion
I noticed Saturday and Sunday are the days with the highest number of rides for the casual group and also within the group of casual riders those days have the highest ride duration, most likely because they use the bikes for things like exercise and leisure activities. Also another thing I noticed in this data set is that in the months synonymous to the summer period the number of casual riders increase as well as the average ride duration of casual riders. I would suggest making discounted prices during the summer period, for incoming members to compel the casual group into subscribing to a membership plan and also creating exercise themed ads to encourage casual riders to become members.
