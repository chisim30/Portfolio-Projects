### Introduction
BikeShare Cyclist a bike transportation company based in Chicago, Illinois is faced with the issue of converting customer (casual) bike riders into members. I received a data set which includes subscriber and customer (casual) riders transport details for four quarters in the year 2019, the stakeholders at Cyclist Bikeshare have asked me to use data to inform decisions on turning customer riders into subscribers. For this project I will be using the six phases of data analysis according to Google, which are;
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act
### Ask
There are 3 main questions which my immediate stakeholder wants me to answer using this data
1. How do customer and subscriber riders differ in bike usage? 
2. Why would customer riders buy
a subscription? 
3. How can the company use digital media to influence customer riders to become
subscribers?
To find answers to the questions, I would first have to come up with a statement of the business
task.

#### Business Task
The main objective of this project is to examine behaviors of customer riders and provide data
informed suggestions that can turn them into subscriber riders.

### Prepare
For the prepare phase, a data set has been provided by the companyâ€™s data team, this clears up
the question of the data sets integrity. I can examine the data and perform cleaning before I start
my analysis.

### Process
The Process phase deals with data cleaning, which is basically making the data more useful for
analyses.

### Conclusion
I noticed Saturday and Sunday are the days with the highest number of rides for the casual group and also within the group of casual riders those days have the highest ride duration, most likely because they use the bikes for things like exercise and leisure activities. Also another thing I noticed in this data set is that in the months synonymous to the summer period the number of casual riders increase as well as the average ride duration of casual riders. I would suggest making discounted prices during the summer period, for incoming members to compel the casual group into subscribing to a membership plan and also creating exercise themed ads to encourage casual riders to become members.
