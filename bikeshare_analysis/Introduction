BikeShare Cyclist a fictional bike transportation company based in Chicago, Illinois is faced with the issue of converting casual bike riders into members. 
I received a data set which includes members and casual riders transport details for four quarters in the year 2019, with the data provided I was able to perform operations like cleaning, manipulation, analysis and visualization all in R stuido and came up with a recommended solution to the issue they were faced with. 
This is a perfect example of using data to drive decision-making.
